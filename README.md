# Vroom--old-

Some of my learning progress with graphics pipelines. I got up and running following the hello triangle tutorial by Marcel Braghetto (https://marcelbraghetto.github.io/a-simple-triangle/). I wanted to implement SDF rendering so I diverged a lot, but much of the core principles are importantly conserved. They are the major elements of any graphics pipeline.
